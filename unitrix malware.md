Old malwares (Unitrix, to mention one [3]) used to be downloaded in the impacted machine in another file format (say, for example, jpeg) and then renamed into .EXE, with the intent of circumventing a possible rule that can detect the suspicious download of certain .EXE files. New malwares (ransomwares, like Cryptowall [4], etc.) also rename the extensions of the documents impacted by the malware (Word, Excel and so on), after they are encrypted.
