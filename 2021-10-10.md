Warning, information overload to follow, please don't be discouraged by the information contained within. There are plenty of opportunities to scale into all of these topics below. Note, if you want to jump straight into contributing as a way of learning, there are some resources at the bottom.

If your goal is a Database Management system, You'll have 2 lobes of study: The algorithmic stuff, and the systems stuff.

In order of (my own opinionated) priority :

1.  Cache and Disk friendly data structures.
    
2.  Scheduling and State Machines
    
3.  Concurrency Control and consensus.
    

On the systems front, (again my opinion) ordered by priority:

0. The OS/Kernel, Mutexes and Atomics

1.  Memory
    
2.  Network
    
3.  Disk
    

**Algos**

For algos #1, I recommend looking at works by Nikolas Askitis such as [https://github.com/naskitis/B-trie](https://github.com/naskitis/B-trie) (which has its own bibliography) and HAT tries [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAT-trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAT-trie) This will give you a taste of the task of how to efficiently make non-linear data structure pack (and be accessed) linearly.

Regarding #2 and #3, they can be delayed for a while, as one could make a rather efficient single-threaded database that persists to disk, and avoid many concurrency headaches.

That said, have a look at methods for formally modelling state machines : [https://barrgroup.com/Embedded-Systems/How-To/State-Machines-Event-Driven-Systems](https://barrgroup.com/Embedded-Systems/How-To/State-Machines-Event-Driven-Systems) [https://barrgroup.com/Embedded-Systems/How-To/Introduction-Hierarchical-State-Machines](https://barrgroup.com/Embedded-Systems/How-To/Introduction-Hierarchical-State-Machines)

Also [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_merge-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_merge-tree) are a good area of study, they are a tad less relevant these days, as they were designed to optimize access to spinny disks by writing append-only. They are still very commonly used in high-write load scenarios as they solve both concurrency and making data serialization linear with the same data structures.

And no dive into databases would be complete without a tour of MVCC (Multi Version Concurrency Control) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control)

**Systems**

The 0th item is kind of sprinkled all around the other three. It wouldn't hurt to learn some high level information on the Kernel and how it schedules functions and processes, and which calls run in the process and which ones have to be scheduled in the kernel. Studying that is an excellent opener to see how the OS handles locks (Mutexes and Futexes) and how the CPU handles "Locks" memory barriers for atomic operations. see [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-linux-synchronization/index.html](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-linux-synchronization/index.html) and [https://locklessinc.com/articles/mutex_cv_futex/](https://locklessinc.com/articles/mutex_cv_futex/)

1.  : Memory managemant is probably the most important systems topic for a DBMS, learning how an OS deals with "pages" of virtual memory. Step number one, I'd look at the man pages for mmap() and some tutorials on how to use it at a high level: [http://beej.us/guide/bgipc/output/html/multipage/mmap.html](http://beej.us/guide/bgipc/output/html/multipage/mmap.html) after that, dig into the guts of Linux VMem with [https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~sbw/links/gorman_book.pdf](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~sbw/links/gorman_book.pdf) to get started.
    
2.  For Networking, the canonical books to learn TCP/IP are [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP_Illustrated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP_Illustrated) . At this point, you might want to also dive straight into the Linux TCP/IP stack itself: [https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/net/ipv4/tcp.c](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/net/ipv4/tcp.c) it is very illuminating.
    
3.  Disk is tricky.. I'd presume these days that everyone is targeting SSDs or faster (NVMe) . MMap is a great place to start. That is, the process of mapping vmem to a region of disk, and when you write to that area of memory, it is transparently (or not so transparently) sync'd to disk. Note that most databases don't use mmap, as they need tighter control over how and when data gets flushed to disk, but again, with SSDs and NVMe it matters a bit less. Eventually, if you're on Linux, you'll want to work with AIO (which is a PITA of an API), but it allows you the fastest and most directly (and most error-prone) access to reading and writing disk. You can get started with that here: [https://www.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu/~vass/linux-aio.txt](https://www.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu/~vass/linux-aio.txt)
    

**Some active open-source projects for you to emulate and also contribute**

Rust's own [Sled](https://github.com/spacejam/sled) is a take at implementing a KV store using modern concurrency and disk paradigms. It is quite readable, although it is in early alpha. I am quite sure that the author would love help with documentation, testing, and cleanup, which would be a great way for you to dig into database programming right away.

[LMDB](https://github.com/LMDB/lmdb/tree/mdb.master/libraries/liblmdb) This, IIRC, does use MMAP. It is wicked fast, highly respected, very stable, and only (last I checked) 6,000 lines of code! That is crazy small for a C program, and is a fantastic example of how to do low-level C programming in a simple and elegant way.

[Mio](https://github.com/carllerche/mio) and [Nix](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix) are canonical polling based IO and Unix syscall wrappers. Contributing-to, or just learning these APIs will give you great insight into systems programming that is very relevant to your area of interest.

[TiKV](https://github.com/pingcap/tikv) A distributed KV store written in Rust. This is a much larger project than those mentioned above, but it contains distribtuted consensus and concurrency control, as well as high performance network protocols, and more!

[Raft in Rust](https://github.com/Hoverbear/raft-rs) - This is an implementation of Raft in Rust that as rather easy to read. Raft is a protocol for executing transactions, that is, getting multiple parties to agree on a value in the face of contentious data updates. A search for Paxos, and Raft, and Raft vs Paxos can be quite illuminating.

Apologies if there is anything in the Rust community that I've left out, but this response seemed large enough. Also, if you have any specific questions, don't hesitate to ask here, or in IRC/#rust, or dm me.

The field of software language engineering (SLE) has emerged based on a strong motivation to connect and integrate different research disciplines such as compiler construction, reverse engineering, software transformation, model-driven engineering, and ontologies. SLE is defined as the application of systematic, disciplined, and measurable approaches to the development, deployment, use, and maintenance of software languages.
