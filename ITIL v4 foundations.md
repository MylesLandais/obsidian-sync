# Key Concepts
## Define
**Service** *enabling* value co-creation through customer outcomes. Without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks.
Utility
Warranty
**Customer** role defines the requirements for service outcomes.
**User** -- uses service
**Service Management** Organizational capability to *enable* value through services
**Sponsor** role that authorizes the budget for service consumption

## Creating Value services 
[VOCR - Service Value Formula White Paper](https://www.axelos.com/resource-hub/white-paper/itil-4-and-vocr-the-service-value-formula)

To achive **Value** the following need to be met. Together with utility and warranty you have value
 	**Cost** can be non-monitary terms spent on an activity or resources
	**Outcome** a result for a stakeholder enabled by one or more outputs
	**Risk**  possible event that could cause harm, defined as the uncertainty of an outcome with a negative outcome.

**Output** deliverable tangible, or intangible  
	
**Utility**  defines the *functionality* offered by a product, *fit for purpose* that removes constraints from the consumer.
**Warranty** assurance that a product or service *fit for use* will meet agreed requirements, Availability, capacity, security, continuity

# ITIL guiding principles
*recomendations for organizational service management*

**Focus on value**
	- Know who is being served and what is truly of value to consumer.
	- Customer Experiance (CX) / User Experiance (UX)
**Start where you are**

	- Leverage feedback loop and evalutation cycles
**Collaborate and promote visibility**
	- Engaged stackholders and avoid organizational silos
	- Unexpected sources can lead to creative solutions
	- critical analysis activites, understanding workflow.
**Think and work holistically**  
	- end-to-end service delivery 
**Keep it simple and practical** 
	- Outcome based thinking to produce practical solutions
	- Minimum number of steps to acomplish an objective
**Optimize and automate**
	- clear vision and objectives, agree to context
	- Cost reduction and reduced human errors
	- technology to scale frequent and repetitive tasks

# Service Value Chain Practices
Continual improvement (5.1.2,) including:
- The continual improvement model (4.6, fig 4.3)
