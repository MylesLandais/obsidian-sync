# Key Concepts
## Definitions
**Service** *enabling* value co-creation through customer outcomes. Without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks.
**Utility**  defines the *functionality* offered by a product, *fit for purpose* that removes constraints from the consumer.
**Warranty** assurance that a product or service *fit for use* will meet agreed requirements, Availability, capacity, security, continuity
**Customer** role defines the requirements for service outcomes.
**User** uses service
**Service Management** Organizational capability to *enable* value through services
**Sponsor** role that authorizes the budget for service consumption

## Creating Value services 
[VOCR - Service Value Formula White Paper](https://www.axelos.com/resource-hub/white-paper/itil-4-and-vocr-the-service-value-formula)

To achive **Value** the following need to be met. Together with utility and warranty you have value
 	**Cost** can be non-monitary terms spent on an activity or resources
	**Outcome** a result for a stakeholder enabled by one or more outputs
	**Risk**  possible event that could cause harm, defined as the uncertainty of an outcome with a negative outcome.

# ITIL guiding principles
*recomendations for organizational service management*

**Focus on value**
	- Know who is being served and what is truly of value to consumer.
	- Customer Experiance (CX) / User Experiance (UX)
**Start where you are** 
	- Current state, Investigating what is already being leveraged, and *avoid starting over*
	- Measuring through direct *observation*
**Progress iteratively with feedback**
	- Not everything happens at once
	- Small iterations are easier to manage, avoid analysis paralysis
	- Leverage feedback loop and evalutation cycles
**Collaborate and promote visibility**
	- Engaged stackholders and avoid organizational silos
	- Unexpected sources can lead to creative solutions
	- critical analysis activites, understanding workflow.
**Think and work holistically**  
	- end-to-end service delivery 
**Keep it simple and practical** 
	- Outcome based thinking to produce practical solutions
	- Minimum number of steps to acomplish an objective
**Optimize and automate**
	- clear vision and objectives, agree to context
	- Maxamize value, reduce costs, reduce human errors
	- technology to scale frequent and repetitive tasks

# Four Dimensions of Service Management
[What are the Four Dimensions of ITIL 4?](https://info.axiossystems.com/blog/what-are-the-four-dimensions-of-itil-4)

![[Pasted image 20211109101811.png]]
*Represent the perspectives that apply to all services being managed*

**Organizations and people**
	- Roles and Responsabilities
	- cultue should support objectives
	- workforce capacity and competence
	- Champion leadership
	- Skill development
	- contribue to creating value
**Information and technology **
	- Workflow management
	- knowledge bases, internal wiki, and documentation
	- Inventory and Assets
	- Business Analytics
**Partners and suppliers**
	- Organization replationship with other organizations
	- Contractual obligations and business agreements
**Value streams and processes**
	- transforming inputs -> outputs
	- Activity coordination	

PESTLE - External constraits (the outside edge of the dimensions)

Policical, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental

# service value system (SVS)
[What is the service value system?](https://info.axiossystems.com/blog/what-is-the-itil4-service-value-system)
![[Pasted image 20211109100331.png]]

Key inputs for opportunity and demand
Outcome as value created
**Guiding Principles** recomendation guiding in all circumstances

# service value chain
[Confused About the ITIL 4 Service Value Chain?](https://info.axiossystems.com/blog/itil-4-service-value-chain)
*Value chain activites transform inputs into outputs*

## Value Chain Activities
**ACROYM PIEDOD**
![[Pasted image 20211109100459.png]]
**Plan** portfolio decisions, creating a shared vision that drives implementation directions for the organization. Information about the service offering performance and trends.
Improve
**Improve** activies for continual improvement and practices, anaylsis of data identifying 
**Engage** Develop an understanding of stakeholder needs, through relationships. Processing feedback
**Design & transition** Time to market, Meeting stakeholders expectations and constraints (costs)
**Obtain/build** Components are available when they are needed and meet spec. *Current Status* improvement for all four dimensions 
**Deliver & support** ensures that users continue to be productive when they need assistance from the service provider
# Best Practices
*Practices* are organizational resources designed for work performance and completing objectives

**Information security management** Ensures Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability

**Relationship management** Establish and Nurturing relationships between customer and provider.

**Supplier management** ensure performance of suppliers

**Availability management** levels of availability meet expectations

**Capacity and performance management** Cost-Effective performance for current and future demands.

**IT asset management** Inventory of objects belonging to IT with a lifecycle, managing costs of assets
	
**Service continuity management**

**Monitoring and event management** Report selected changes of state. Events defined by the state change for IT assets

i) Release management (5.2.9)
j) Service configuration management (5.2.11)
**Deployment management** Moving to live enviornments

**Continual improvement**
	analytical analysis with identification leading to factual desicion making driving improvements 
	
**Continual Improvment Model** [](https://www.axelos.com/resource-hub/white-paper/itil4-continual-improvement-model-vuca-environment-white-paper)
![Image of Figure 1.1 illustrates ITIL Continual Improvement Model](https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt0bc74001569a8a62/blt9137b2555e594615/6087cedd441d9c0ccf651815/itil-4-continual-improvement-in-a-vuca-environment-figure-1-1-600x550_1.jpg)

-	*Take Action* performing the work.
-	*Where are we now* determind current state.
-	*How do we get there?* focused on outling action plan 
-	*What is the vision?* defines the improvement initiatives that align with org goals and objectives
-	*Where do we want to be?* Define in quantified metrics, Key Performance Indicators
-	*Did we get there?* Compare to baseline, determind if goals have been met
-	*how do we keep the momentum going?*

**Change control => Change Enablement**
*Changes* are for planned changes, Integration and Continual Development (CI/CD), and avoiding conflicts *Change Authority* should be assigned for each type of change and change model.
- *Normal Changes* require risk assesment, scheduling after approval by *change authority*, not considered routine
- *Standard Changes* are well understood with documentation, low-risk, and have been pre-authorized. 
- *Emergency Changes* high impact/urgency, must be done as soon as possible.

**Incident management**
may include scripts for collecting information, formal processed for logging incidents, and required knowledge to investigate issues.

**Problem management**
activities can be treated as improvement opportunities and result in change enablement
*identifty*, *problem control*, *error control.*

**Service request management** 
	Quality of service handling requests for users, or user representative normal part of service delivery.
	*Design and transition* standard changes to services initiated and fulfilled through service requests.
	*Deliver and support*

**Service desk** centralized service desk is where all employes work in a single location

r) **Service level management** (5.2.15)
	*customer engagement* asking customer how technology can help their work
	*Improve* feedback from users as recommendations for improvements
	
## Terminology
Availability (5.2.1)
b) IT asset (5.2.6)
c) Event (5.2.7)
**Configuration item** any component of IT services that require management 
e) Change (5.2.4)
f) Incident (5.2.5)
**Problem** a cause, potential cause, of one or more incidents
**Known error** is a problem that has been analyzed but has yet to be resolved.
# Service Value Chain Practices
Continual improvement (5.1.2,) including:
- The continual improvement model (4.6, fig 4.3)
**Change control** or *Change enablement* evaluates the risk assesment and process for scheduling IT changes including updates and migrations. 
**Incident management** minimize the impact of incident occurance with prompt resolutions
**Problem management** Reduce the occurance of incidents through casual analysis. Managing workarounds and known issues. *workarounds* may reduce the impact of an incident/problem for which a full resolution is not available.
e) Service request management (5.2.16)
**Service desk** provides an entry point of contact, capturing incident resolution and service requests
	*centralized* service desk requires supporting technologies and must have remote access tools.
	
 **Service level management** targets for service performance, delivery of a service can be assesed, monitored, and managed.
