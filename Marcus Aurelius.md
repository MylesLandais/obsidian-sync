You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.

The universe is change; our life is what our thoughts make it.

Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.

Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking.

Death smiles at us all, but all a man can do is smile back.

It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinions than our own.

If it is not right do not do it; if it is not true do not say it.

The soul becomes dyed with the color of its thoughts.

Poverty is the mother of crime.

It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.
