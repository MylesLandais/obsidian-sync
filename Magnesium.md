For the treatment of Migraine headaches

Magnesium deficiency is related to factors that promote headaches, including neurotransmitter release and vasoconstriction [[53](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/#en53)]. People who experience migraine headaches have lower levels of serum and tissue magnesium than those who do not.

However, research on the use of magnesium supplements to prevent or reduce symptoms of migraine headaches is limited. Three of four small, short-term, placebo-controlled trials found modest reductions in the frequency of migraines in patients given up to 600 mg/day magnesium [[53](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/#en53)]. The authors of a review on migraine prophylaxis suggested that taking 300 mg magnesium twice a day, either alone or in combination with medication, can prevent migraines [[54](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/#en54)].

In their evidence-based guideline update, the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society concluded that magnesium therapy is “probably effective” for migraine prevention [[55](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/#en55)]. Because the typical dose of magnesium used for migraine prevention exceeds the UL, this treatment should be used only under the direction and supervision of a healthcare provider.
