Hi. About 3 months ago, I posted my lecture library on a whim here. I was quite surprised at how well-received it was. I believe it hit number 1 for the week or something like that.

I had a bit of regret that I hadn't spent more time getting it right. There were typos, loose files, classes I hadn't added yet etc etc. One still-funny-to-me example that springs to mind; The Noam Chomsky folder was titled Noam Chomsly. CHOMSLY!

Well, I can't say it's perfect now, but I will say it's done. On my trusty WD 2tb external, it shows up as a flat 999 gigs. Some of that gets lost in uploading, and some of it get lost in downloading, so I believe the final torrent is 916 gigs.

Everyone here has been an absolute delight, helpful, patient and informative. Deep thanks to you all. There wouldn't even be a torrent without the DH community.

What's new in the final version? Roughly 50% more data, 1k more videos, and 30+ more days of content. I've expanded the philosophy folder, it's now philosophy, society, and BLM. Similarly, the neuroscience folder is now neuroscience, biology, and general science. The psychology folder, despite only having a single word title, wallops the other two folders in stature.

I know data curation types aren't so keen on complex folder hierarchies, but I prefer it to a tagging system. Hope that's not too big an issue for people. Part of it is that it works best on an androidTV player, which is how I enjoy it. Part of it is that I just like having folder systems big enough to get lost in. It makes it feel almost like I'm walking the corridors of a real library.

I've made a sub for posting updates, which is at [r/thelibrary](https://www.reddit.com/r/thelibrary/). In theory I shouldn't need to be posting too many updates after this one, but if anybody has corrections or suggestions or anything, that's a good place to reach me at (other than this thread, ofc). Everything is currently still up on google drive for now, which can be found at the library subreddit.

I'll post the torrent link in the comments. Credit for the torrent goes to [u/acl1704](https://www.reddit.com/u/acl1704/) Thanks, you handsome bunch of conscientious cuties.
