 How to protect your business and Internet properties

1.  [Onboard to Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) to protect your Internet properties.
2.  DDoS is enabled out of the box, and you can also [customize the protection settings](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200172676-Understanding-Cloudflare-DDoS-protection).
3.  Follow our preventive [best practices](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170166-Best-Practices-DDoS-preventative-measures), to ensure that both your Cloudflare settings and your origin server settings are optimized. As an example, make sure that you allow only traffic from [Cloudflare’s IP range](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/). Ideally, ask your upstream Internet Service Provider (ISP) to apply an access control list (ACL), otherwise, attackers may target your servers’ IP addresses directly and bypass your protection.
