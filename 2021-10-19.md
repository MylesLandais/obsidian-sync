CAFFEINE THREAD Caffeine does not provide energy; it alters the receptors which tell us we’re tired. Nerd out with me as I examine everyone’s favorite nootropic (drugs improving cognitive function), the worlds most used nervous system stimulant, caffeine.

Caffeine’s stimulant effect comes from its impact on adenosine receptors in the neural membrane. Adenosine is a central nervous system neuromodulator. When adenosine binds to its receptors, neural activity slows down, and you feel tired. Adenosine facilitates sleep.

The activation of numerous neural circuits by caffeine also causes the pituitary gland to secrete hormones which cause the adrenal glands to produce more adrenalin. Adrenalin is the “fight or flight” hormone, thus it increases your attention level. Pros and cons here.
Caffeine, like most drugs, increases the production of dopamine in the brain’s pleasure circuits, thus helping to maintain the dependency on it. Physical and mental dependency is common, and like most drugs, tolerance increases with usage.
if you are seeking caffeine, for whatever the reason, and through whichever form (tea, coffee, pills, etc.), avoid: •high sugar content •dairy •high fructose corn syrup •food colorings and dyes These are disease promoters and hormone disrupters.

Traditional Indian medicine (Ayurvedic medicine) limits caffeine intake to the amount of one cup of coffee per day at most. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) educates to avoid caffeine as it stimulates stress hormones and reduces qi (energy), which cannot be regained.
