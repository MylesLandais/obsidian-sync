completed Jason Dion's Udemy course and used his 6 practice exams. I completed the exam included with the course and my first initial score was 62%, ouch; studied what I got wrong and understood why it was wrong and why the correct answer was correct (I can't stress this enough, this was the most effective study habit for me; do this for every test/exam you take).

I then used Professor Messer and got a different perspective. I would listen to him while cutting the grass, and at work when things were slow as well as any other down time I had.
